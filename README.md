Hi and welcome to my Chess application. This is my first time building a chess application, so mistakes will be made. That being said, I will be updating this frequently until I am satisfied with the application. The first objective is to get a game of chess to be functional, i.e You can play chess with its accompaning rule set for each piece. The second, and much more lofty, objective is to make an A.i play back. This will be the area of trial and error against my program. For now that's all I've got, enjoy.
